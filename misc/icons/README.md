# HB Icons set

Icons sets based on Yaru icons (default gnome icons on ubuntu).
But it is delivered with multiple colours themes, and a script to create your own colour.

 - add_icon.py leet you choose an icon from your Downloads directory (you might want to rename the directory in the file because it depends on your language), and add it to all teh themes with a specific name (if you want to change the icon for thunderbird for example).
 - install.sh install the icons sets in ~/.local/share/icons (no need for sudo rights).
 - colorize.py alows you to create a new colour. You can choose to fully colorise it or to just change the theme.
 - build_multiple_colours.py create a lot of new themes, just edit the list of colours in the file.
